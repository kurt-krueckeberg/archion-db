Join different tables based on condition 

* Good article on link:https://sqlines.com/mysql/how-to/join-different-tables-based-on-condition[how to join different tables based on condition]

todo: Compare what is going on in the link above with what is going in my `~/db-arcion/join-examples.sql` database. Are they isomorphic?
 
One I make them equivalent, alter the `union all` query technique at the end of the `join_examples` database, whose schema is in `join-examples.sql`,
and use the `left join` technique from the article above. 

Then try to employ these further elaborationson the technique:

This is an example of a database with a multi-column join

```sql
drop database if exists join_examples;

create database join_examples;

use join_examples;
