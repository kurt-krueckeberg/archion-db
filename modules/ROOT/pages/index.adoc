TODO: Events always have a DATE; otherwise, it is not truly an event. A fact may not have a date.

== MySQL Settings for DATE of 000-00-00

To check MySQL global and session settings for `sql_mode`, which controls whether things like zero dates (0000-00-00)
are allowed

1. Check Global SQL Mode (Affects All Databases)

[source,sql]
----
SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'sql_mode';
____

If `sql_mode` contains `NO_ZERO_DATE` or `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`, then zero dates are not allowed.

2. Check Session SQL Mode (For Your Current Connection)


[source,sql]
----
SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE 'sql_mode';
____

3. Check SQL Mode for a Specific Database

There’s no direct way to check SQL mode per database, but you can switch to the database and check the session mode:

4. Allow Zero Dates in MySQL

If you want to allow `0000-00-00` values, remove `NO_ZERO_DATE` and `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` from `sql_mode`:

[,sql]
----
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';
----

Then restart MySQL:

[,bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart mysql
----

== Introduction

The custodian of the Kirchenbücher for Schaumburg-Lippe is the Niedersachsen Landesarchiv (Lower Saxony
state archive), and their Kirchenbücher holdings can be viewed using the link:http://www.arcinsys.niedersachsen.de/arcinsys/llist?nodeid=g1722&page=1&reload=true&sorting=41[Arcysys catolog system].

Digitized images of of Schaumburg-Lippe holdings of the Niedersachsen Landesarchiv are availbe (for a subscription)
on the the Archion Protestant Kirchenbücher link:https://archion.de[portal].

== Design

Unlike a genealogy program, this database doesn't represent individuals over their lifetime, rather individuals
are tied to an event, they `event_persons`, conceptually tied to a specific event.

The goal of the database is to identify with the greatest certainty possible whether an individual mentioned in
one record is the same individual mentioned in a different record several years later. To do this, all of the
individual's (the specific `event_persons.id`) identifying characteristics need to be captured, so they can be
compared. Besides the individual's name, we capture there facts about an indvidual, including the date and place
of the fact:
 
* baptism
* birth--including whether it was legitimate or illegitimate
* birth order
* sex birth order
* approximate birth year--calculated based on the **age** listed in the record
* burial
* confirmation
* death
* death cause
* funeral
* gender
* job description and place of employment (which may differ from place of residence)
* marriage proclamation (also known as **marriage ban**)
* residence--consisting of address number and locality's name
* widow or widower
* remarks about the individual 

The relationship facts (including the date and place, if mentioned, for the relationship) captured are:

* parent-child relationship
* husband-wife relationship
* infant-sponsor relationship

NOTE: The approximate birth year is derived from an individual's **age** found in a church record.

== Natural Language Searches

Once the facts above have been put in the database, natural language searches on surname and given names allow us to
generate snapshots of an individual.

In MySQL, full-text search is done using `match()` and `against`. `match()` specifies the columns you want to search, and
`against()` takes the search expression:

[source,sql]
----
select some_col1, some_col2, etc 
    from some_view
  where
    match(title,description) against(‘Krückeberg’ in natural language mode);
----

NOTE: `in natural language mode` is the default mode, so it can be omitted.


You can also perform boolean searches using boolean mode. See https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-full-text-search/mysql-natural-language-full-text-searches/[MySQL
Natural Language Full-Text Searches].
