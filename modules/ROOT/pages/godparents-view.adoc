= Godparents

Godparents is a view because the name of the godparent and the infanct
can be derived from the relationships table:

The relationship fact `godparent_child` allows us to insert a newly found
godparent into the `godparents` table. A child may have more than one
godparent and individual who is a godparent may have been or may yet be
the godparent of other infants. The primary key is thus the pair (`id`,
`child_id`), where both `godparents.id` and `godparents.child_id` are
foreign keys refereing the respecitve `event_persons.id`.
