== All Couples With or Without Any Children

Create a Left Outer Join of all couples--married and unmarried
and then do a left out join with children. Children being those
`event_persons.id` who are in `person2` in a `parent_child`
relationship fact. 

This is like the view `parents_with_children` in that we 
do a left join that shows which married couples have children
and which couples, who were unmarried at the time, had il
legitimate children, and which married couples have no
children who can be joined with them.
