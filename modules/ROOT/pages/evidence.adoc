== Propsective inter-event Relationship Tables

To link couples based on shared identifying attributes found in
different church entries could be done. This should be based on keeping
tracking as many common identifying facts as possible, perhaps along
with notes or comments about these common linking facts. One idea would
be a `couples` table, along with a `children` table and a
`couples_evidence` table that contains facts from several different
recorded church entries. Maybe we also need to include facts like
jobs-held and residences lived in?

It would be good to review Shannon Greenâ€™s article that inspired this
database.

This is one such prospective table for `couples_evidence`.

[source,sql]
----
create table if not exists couples_evidence (
   id int not null auto_increment primary key,
   couple_id int not null,
   relationships_id int not null,
   unique (couple_id, relationships_id),
   foreign key (couple_id) references couples(id),
   foreign key (relationships_id) references relationships(id)
) engine = INNODB;

== Table for Individaul Facts found in a Recorded Event?

A view with all the individual facts that are not related

== Table for an Evidence-Based Prospective Family Tree

This table is related to conclusions for common identity between
`image_persons` I think it should hold the common shared facts.

[source,sql]
----
create table if not exists common_characteristitcs/identities (
 person1 int not null,
 person2 int not null,
 ????
 primary key(person1,  person_inages
);
